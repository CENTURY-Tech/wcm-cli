# WCM CLI
A CLI tool to shrinkwrap and parse projects for WCM usage

### Description
This CLI is primarily designed to shrinkwrap the runtime dependencies of your project, and prepare projects that wish to benefit from [WCM](https://github.com/CENTURY-Tech/wcm).

Aside from the primary aims of this CLI, it is also capable of estimating the global integrity of your project and its √èdependencies, and it is also able to parse small parts of your source code in such a way that you may benefit fully from [WCM](https://github.com/CENTURY-Tech/wcm).
